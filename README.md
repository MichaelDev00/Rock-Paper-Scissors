# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Python command-line game where the user plays Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the user inputs their choice. The program compares the choices and determines if the user wins, loses, or draws.

The user is prompted to enter “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors”. If the input is invalid, the program warns the user to enter a correct choice. After each round, the user can decide whether to continue playing or quit.

Requirements: Python 3.x (no external libraries needed).

To run the script, use the command:
python rock_paper_scissors.py

The project contains two files: the script file rock_paper_scissors.py and this README.
